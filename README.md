# nour - Digital Money Passport
A unified, portable financial identity system enabling seamless cross-border banking access.
_(This is a code bundle for nour. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/p9yxJrNiXLTeaVMtttT9YT/nour.)_

## Overview
The Digital Money Passport addresses the fragmented global financial identity system by creating a single digital credential that allows users to access financial services across borders without repeatedly going through KYC processes.

## Problem Statement
- **No Standardization**: Each bank maintains its own fragmented trust network
- **Onboarding Burden**: Users must rebuild financial identity when moving countries
- **Border Friction**: National IDs and banking credentials lack interoperability

## Solution
A borderless financial identity system powered by:
- Visa's global payment rails
- Decentralized Identity (DID) technology
- Self-sovereign identity principles

## Core Components

### 1. Self-Sovereign Identity
Users create and control their verified banking credentials

### 2. VisaNet Integration
Leverages Visa's existing infrastructure for global reach

### 3. API Interoperability Layer
Enables seamless connection between banks, fintechs, and identity systems

### 4. AI Compliance Layer
Automated fraud detection and regulatory compliance monitoring


## Running the code

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
